# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze various green energy stocks performances over two years so that Steve can decide on whick stocks are best to invest in.

## Comparison of Stock Performance
In 2017, most of the stocks did very well compared to 2018 where most of the stocks did very poor. 2018 was probably a year of recession. I will advise Steve's parents to buy stocks at ENPH and RUN because these stocks did well despite the regression.
